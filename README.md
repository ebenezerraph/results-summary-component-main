## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I used this challenge as an opportunity to learn TailwindCSS and practice alongside. Although I faced a couple of challenges, I overcame them, and I believe this has helped me to solidify my knowledge.

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to gaining more experience with TailwindCSS in my projects and figuring out how to use local JSON data to dynamically create website content.

### Useful resources

- [Official TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - This is my go-to TailwindCSS resource, as it has a ton of helpful and well structured tutorials on each of the basic TailwindCSS concepts. I'd highly recommend it, any time, any where.
- [nekoCalc](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - nekoClac's PX to REM converter helped me convert the `px` length unit to `rem`, for easier customization and a pixel-perfect design.
